# Advanced Web Application Pentester - HTB Academy

This repository contains scripts and notes created while going through the **Advanced Web Application Pentester** course on Hack The Box Academy. The course is part of the Certified Web Exploitation Expert (CWEE) training, focusing on advanced techniques for web application penetration testing.


## Introduction

This repository is a collection of scripts, notes, and resources developed while following the CWEE training on HTB Academy. The scripts are tailored to various exercises and labs encountered throughout the course, aimed at exploiting web application vulnerabilities such as LDAP injection, SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more. There are tools that do each of these things WAY better than my scripts, but wanted to create my own so I understand the process better. These scripts probably have very limited use for anyone else, but sharing anyways :)
